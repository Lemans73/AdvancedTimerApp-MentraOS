### Future

I do this in my free time so updates will be very irregular. <br>
Because of AugmentOS changed to MentraOS, i will have to go trough some changes. <br>
Also i have been working on a version 2.5 which i will combine with this version for better in-app controll and looks on-screen (with partially head-up display). 

Any tips or questions are welcome! Join Discord of MentraOS (https://discord.gg/5ukNvkEAqT) and connect with me (T_073)
