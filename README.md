# Advanced Timer App

This app is an advanced timer utility that combines a timer, stopwatch, and Pomodoro functionality in one interface. It supports both voice and app control, customizable durations, auto-lap features, and flexible on-screen information levels, making it ideal for productivity, workouts, and focused work sessions.

### Updated settings for better app control

- Fully intergrate MentraOS. (based on Mentra-OS-Cloud-Example).
- Better control for timer options, utilizing text field instead of select field.
- Better control for stopwatch auto-interval options, utilizing text fields instead of select fields..
- Better control for display options, choose how much information you wish to display.
- Control-Input Voice/App selection will also enable/disable microphone.
